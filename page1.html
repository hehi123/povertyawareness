		<h2> What is Poverty</h2>

		<p>Poverty is the lack of needs to sustain a living such as clothes, food, money, and shelter. Other definitions may be the state of having an insufficient amount of needs. While this state of being poor is common, there are different degrees of poverty. However, it is the same definition for all degrees either way.</p>

		<h2> Why is poverty a problem?</h2>
		
		<p>How much do you spend on a single day? Think about it: You have to go to work, you have to feed yourself, or maybe add in all the unnecessary expenses that you spend on. It's a lot of money, right? Now, imagine doing all of the same things I mentioned above, but by only spending $1.25. It would be way harder, right? </p>

		<p> Sadly, this is the issue faced by 1.3 billion people around the world. That's about 17% of all the people in the world! This also means that you, reading this, have a 17% chance of living by with that amount of money. It's very saddening to see people go through these hardships, but the actual effects of poverty are even more heartbreaking. </p>

<br>
		<h2> How poverty affects health: </h2>
			<p>Poverty causes malnutrition, the overall lack of nutrients in a person's body because of a lack of food. This is a serious problem, especially with children, and poverty has led to 165 million children under the age of 5 having a reduced rate of growth. </p>
			<p>Advancements in medicine have led to diseases like diarrhea and pneumonia being easily preventable. However, due to a lack of budget for affording modern healthcare services, diseases preventable by vaccines take the lives of 2 million children. </p>
<br>
		<h2> How poverty affects daily living: </h2>
			<p>In the modern world, electricity is vital to the life of a person, as many of the things we use nowadays involve electricity. Now, think of living without electricity. It's so hard and unbearable for the normal person, and yet, a quarter of the world's population go by their daily lives without electricity. </p>
			<p>A person is expected to finish at least a college degree and get a good job that could pay for his/her living. However, due to the rising costs in education, 264 million children around the world don't go to school, and only 45% of students aged 15-17 actually finish secondary school. </p>
<br>
		<h2> How poverty affects society: </h2>
			<p>The social structure of a certain country is defined by it's wealth gap, which is basically the disparity of wealth between the rich and the poor. A large wealth gap causes a huge disparity between the rich peoples and the poor peoples of a certain nation. It causes animosity between the 2 groups and the lack of unity between them. </p>
			<p>Any nation should strive to fix this, as if this is left untreated, the poor would become poorer, and their actions just to survive, most especially crime, will most likely threaten the stability of the entire nation as a whole. The lack of unity caused by the wealth gap would be a guarantee for internal conflict within the country as well.</p>
