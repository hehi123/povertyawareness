			<h2> How you can solve poverty as a person?</h2>

			<p>Poverty as a whole is difficult to solve, since poverty will always exist as long as people will be greedy. However, if the public and the government work together to cut poverty, then it is possible to eliminate poverty.</p>
			
			<p>Creating more jobs can be a start to cutting poverty. The reason there are people in poverty is because of insufficient jobs. Instead of begging in the streets, an ideal solution is to find a job instead. However, there are not enough jobs to support the whole population. While NCR (National Capital Region) can support a large population because of its cities, there are still people looking for jobs but cannot seem to get one. </p>
			
			<p>Minimum wage also affects poverty. Minimum wage is the lowest wage employers can pay their employees. In 2018, the minimum wage in the Philippines was Php 537.00/day. With the increasing inflation occurring in the country, this may not be enough to support a large family. A family of 3 perhaps, but not a family of 7. </p>

			<p>The reason money is the cause of as to why poverty exists is because people need to buy food, healthcare, shelter, and clothes to live. However, programs that can provide them the essential needs can also be a big help in reducing poverty. Programs such as free education can help them. Providing them healthy sanitation and healthcare will also greatly benefit them.</p>

		<h2> How can we fix the problem through the use of ICT?</h2>

				<p>ICT can be used to raise awareness on the key issues of poverty. Websites like what we made can be used to spread awareness on poverty, 
				since most of use use ICT. And since awareness is the first step in solving a problem, we can easily formulate ways of solving poverty already 
				now that people are aware of it. We can fund projects that support the poverty combat by eradicating it through websites that support funding.</p>
